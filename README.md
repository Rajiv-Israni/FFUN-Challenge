# FFUN-Challenge

I have Provided 2 folders, frontend and backend respectively.

The backend folder has rest apiu setup.

First you need to install modules in both frameworks to operate which you do by npm i or npm install. Go to backend folder and run npm i or npm install and same for searchengine folder. Then you need to start both the servers so for that i have configured them in such a way that you run npm start in both the folders and it will start.

The backend server runs on 5000 and frontend in 3000, i have also enabled cors headers for that purpose.

Thanks!
